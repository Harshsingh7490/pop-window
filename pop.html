            I wanted to take the time to tell you just how much you mean to me.<br> You’ve become a rock in my life, something solid and secure I can lean on.<br> Knowing you’re by my side makes me so eternally grateful, I can hardly put it into words. I had felt happiness before, but nothing prepared me for the happiness I feel when I’m with you.<br> I don’t know what I said or did that made me lucky enough to deserve you, but I will spend the rest of my life trying to be the best man I can be so that you can be proud. Thank you for all that you do and have done for me. You have taught me what it is to love. You’ve shown me how beautiful life can be.
